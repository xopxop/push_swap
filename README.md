1. Introduction
2. How to use
3. Algorithm
Checker Program
PushSwap Program
  This is my algorithm
    I separated into 2 main algorithms, the pivot is 3 numbers, one will take care if the stack have no more than 3 numbers and the other will take care if there are more than 3 numbers 
  - Algo max 3
    
  - Algo more than 3
